# Hotel-Revenue-Analytics-PowerBI





### \#Ô∏è‚É£ 1. Project Overview



This project features an interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to provide comprehensive **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis** for a chain of hotels. It enables stakeholders (Revenue Managers, General Managers) to monitor, analyze, and optimize hotel performance across various dimensions, including categories, platforms, and seasonality (weekday/weekend).

### \#Ô∏è‚É£ 2. Key Metrics and Insights


### üéØ Key Metrics Analyzed

The dashboard is centered around crucial hospitality and revenue management metrics:

* **Revenue:** Total revenue generated (e.g., **1.69 Billion**).
* **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** The primary measure of hotel success.
* **Occupancy %:** The percentage of occupied rooms.
* **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** The average rental income per occupied room.
* **DSRN (Daily Sold Room Nights):** The total number of rooms sold.
* **Cancellation % and Average Rating:** Metrics for operational health and guest satisfaction.

### ‚ú® Core Insights

* **Category Performance:** Breakdown of revenue and occupancy by **Luxury** and **Business** segments.
* **Platform Analysis:** Comparison of **Realisation %** and **ADR** across booking platforms (**direct online, direct offline, aggregator, etc.**).
* **Geographical/Property Analysis:** Detailed table view for comparison of property performance across cities (e.g., **Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad**).
* **Time Series Trend:** Visualization of trends for **RevPAR, ADR, and Occupancy** over a specific time period (e.g., Weekly/Monthly).
