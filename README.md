# Hotel-Revenue-Analytics-PowerBI





### \#Ô∏è‚É£ 1. Project Overview



```markdown
This project features an interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to provide comprehensive **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis** for a chain of hotels. It enables stakeholders (Revenue Managers, General Managers) to monitor, analyze, and optimize hotel performance across various dimensions, including categories, platforms, and seasonality (weekday/weekend).
